A theoretically simple tool set for creating finished gear models for 
use coming off a 3d printer.  Hard work done by Greg Frost, I am
adding features as I need them with an attempt to retain backwards compatibility
and ease of use.  Be warned original units were weird, it is susggested you use module
to specifiy your gear, not circular_pitch.  

To create a gear compatible with V5.0, the conversion is:
 ||	module = circular_pitch/180
 ||	or 
 ||	circular_pitch = 180* module

**note circular_pitch does not correspond to the techincal deffinition which is measured in mm,

Modified several default values, and may modify units to match reality
Pressure angle changed from 28 to 20
found conversion factor to get "real" gears to come out of the tool

==================================
||		Usage					||
==================================

**	Gear arguments	**
*	arguments that share a line are alterantive, only one should be used
*	all units are mm unless otherwise stated

These units make gears that can mate
	module_gear, circular_pitch, diametral_pitch			//circular pitch in wierd units
	pressure_angle=28,										//tooth pressure angle
	twist=0,


these units can vary between gears in the same train	
	gear_thickness			//thickness of thin web?
	rim_thickness			//tooth width
	circles	= 0				//qty of circular cutouts in gear face
	number_of_teeth=15		//number of teeth on gear
	clearance = 0.2	
	rim_thickness=8		
	rim_width=5			
	hub_thickness=10		//Thickness of the center hub
	hub_diameter=15			//Diameter of the center hub
	bore_diameter=5		

Advanced Settings
	backlash=0,
	involute_facets=0)
