Modified several default values, and may modify units to match reality
Pressure angle changed from 28 to 20

==================================
||		Usage					||
==================================

**	Gear arguments	**
*	arguments that share a line are alterantive, only one should be used
*	all units are mm unless otherwise stated

These units make gears that can mate
	circular_pitch, diametral_pitch			// circular pitch in wierd units
	pressure_angle=28,	//tooth pressure angle
	twist=0,


these units can vary between gears in the same train	
	gear_thickness			//thickness of thin web?
	rim_thickness			//tooth width
	circles	= 0				//qty of circular cutouts in gear face
	number_of_teeth=15		//number of teeth on gear
	clearance = 0.2	
	rim_thickness=8		
	rim_width=5			
	hub_thickness=10		//Thickness of the center hub
	hub_diameter=15			//Diameter of the center hub
	bore_diameter=5		

Advanced Settings
	backlash=0,
	involute_facets=0)
